![Ledge Zeppelin](http://ledgezeppelin.com/img/lz-logo.svg)

Ledge Zeppelin service is a REST style search API for finding legislators by location and hierarchy. Legislator resources returned by the API have attached contact information including phone numbers, email address, and social networks.

The application architecture consists of these parts:

- LZ Service - the REST API, built in Node.js and Express
- LZ Admin aka [Sammy Hagar](http://github.com/revolution-messaging/sammy-hagar) - admin interface for managing legislator info
- MongoDB Database - for storing legislator and user info
- MySQL Database - for storing zip code data
- Archive Script - daily cron job for archiving legislators whose terms have expired

The devops consists of these parts:

- Build System - powered by Cake
- Deployment - managed via Heroku
- Tests - powered my Mocha and Suite-tooth
- Logging - ?? (TODO)
- Analytics - managed by New Relic (TODO - more details?)

## App Tiers

#### Dev

- URL: http://localhost:3005/

To launch the app locally, ssh into vagrant box and run `npm run dev`.

Then you can connect to the app via a tool like Paw or Curl, or launch and use the LZ Admin interface.

#### Staging

- Server: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/lz-service-staging/
- Deploy: Push staging branch

#### Production

- URL: http://api.ledgezeppelin.com/
- Deploy: Ask Josh

## Other Architecture Notes

- LZ Service is an an Express.js app written in CoffeeScript that resides in the `/src` folder
- there is also some clustering managed by the server.js and worker.js in the root folder
- all Legislator data is stored in the Mongo database; MySQL is never written to
- how are uploads handled? (TODO)
- some test files are written with [Suite-tooth](http://github.com/dylanized/suite-tooth) library, others in traditional Mocha style.
